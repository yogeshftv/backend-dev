Access Token & Refresh Token both are exactly same the only difference between them is the token expiration duration.

a. Access Token 
- Lifespan: Access Tokens have a relatively short lifespan, typically measured in minutes to hours. The specific duration may vary based on the security policy of the authentication system.

- Purpose: Access Tokens serve as credentials that grant access to protected resources. They are issued after successful authentication and are used to authorize subsequent requests to APIs or other protected endpoints.

- Validation Process: Upon successful validation of the user's credentials (usually through a login process), the server issues an Access Token.

- Usage: Access Tokens are utilized by the client (e.g., a web or mobile application) to access protected resources on behalf of the user. For example, clients include the Access Token in the Authorization header of API requests. The server then verifies the token to ensure that the client has the necessary permissions to access the requested resource.
 
- Expiration Handling: Access Tokens have a defined expiration time, and clients need to handle token expiration gracefully. If an Access Token expires, the client needs to request a new one by going through the authentication process again.

b. Refresh Token
- Alias: Refresh Tokens are sometimes referred to as "Session Storage."
- Lifespan: Refresh Tokens are long-lived, designed to persist for an extended duration, often measured in days or weeks.
- Storage: They are provided to the user and stored securely on the server-side database.
- Login Convenience: Unlike Access Tokens, users do not need to log in again and again. When an Access Token expires, the user can use a special endpoint to exchange their Refresh Token for a new Access Token.
- Refresh Mechanism: The client sends the Refresh Token to the server. The server validates the Refresh Token against the stored version in the database. If the tokens match and are still valid, a new Access Token is issued without requiring the user to re-enter their credentials.
- Enhanced Security: The use of Refresh Tokens enhances security by reducing the frequency of password inputs, as the user only needs to go through the full login process when obtaining a new Refresh Token.

In summary, Access Tokens and Refresh Tokens work together in an authentication system. Access Tokens provide short-term access to resources, while Refresh Tokens enable long-term access without requiring the user to log in frequently. The combination of both adds a layer of security and convenience to the authentication process in applications.
